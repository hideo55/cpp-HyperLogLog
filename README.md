# HyperLoglog

C++ implementation of [HyperLogLog](http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf) algorithm and [HIP(Historic Inverse Probability) Estimator](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.3284v5.pdf).

## Usage

HyperLoglog is a headers-only library so you just need to include "hyperloglog.hpp" and "murmur3.h" to use this project.
You can use normal HyperLogLog counter class(hll::HyperLogLog) and HyperLogLog counter with HIP Estimator class(hll::HyperLogLogHIP).

```C++

#include <vector>
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include "hyperloglog.hpp"

using namespace hll;

int main(){
    HyperLogLog hll(10);
    std::vector<string> somedata;

    //Load data to somedata

    std::vector<std::string>::iterator iter = somedata.begin();
    std::vector<std::string>::iterator iter_end = somedata.end();
    for(;iter != iter_end; ++iter){
        hll.add(iter->c_str(), iter->size());
    }

    double cardinality = hll.estimate();

    std::cout << "Cardinality:" << cardinality << std::endl;

    std::ofstream ofs("path/to/dumpfile");
    hll.dump(ofs); // It can restore by restore().

    return 0;
}
```

If you are using [Clib](https://github.com/clibs/clib), you can get source files by `clib install hideo55/cpp-HyperLogLog`.
